# mohacdex

a pokémon database that doesn't include the junk i don't care about.  mostly made for my own sake and as a learning exercise; idk how useful this will be for any one else.
modelled heavily after [porydex](https://github.com/CatTrinket/porydex), which is sure to be more useful—maybe check that out instead?
